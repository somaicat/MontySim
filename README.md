# MontySim

This is a small project for simulating Monty Hall style games and measuring the probability of various outcomes.
Normally I wouldn't bother putting something like this on something like github, but I'm currently having computer storage problems, so this will have to do. Also I've never used github before so this is a good chance to learn more about it.
