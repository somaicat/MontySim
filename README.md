# MontySim

This is a small project for simulating Monty Hall style games and measuring the probability of various outcomes.
Normally I wouldn't bother putting something like this on something like github, but I'm currently having computer storage problems, so this will have to do. Also I've never used github before so this is a good chance to learn more about it.

Todo:
Needs a fair bit of optimization, there's probably variables I don't need.
Something weird is up with multithreading, for some reason I seem to be losing overall effeciency by using multiple cores. Gonna check what it looks like as far as the threads affinity goes. Needs research.
