# MontySim

This is a small project for simulating Monty Hall style games and measuring the probability of various outcomes.
Normally I wouldn't bother putting something like this on something like github, but I'm currently having computer storage problems, so this will have to do. Also I've never used github before so this is a good chance to learn more about it.


###### Todo:
Add argument for total number of games allowed to play.
Display how long the simulation has been running.
Solve the bias in +1billion runs of the simulation. If it's too ineffecient to do so, perhaps provide an option of PRNG algorithms to use
