# MontySim

This is a small project for simulating Monty Hall style games and measuring the probability of various outcomes.
Normally I wouldn't bother putting something like this on something like github, but I'm currently having computer storage problems, so this will have to do. Also I've never used github before so this is a good chance to learn more about it.


###### Todo:
* I should make sure there's no race condition like issues involving the monitor code and when the program closes. Specifically, the possibility that it might free the score info while the monitor code is still running.
